<p><strong>Links to Other Websites.</strong></p>
<p data-find="_10">Our website contains links to third party Websites.  Our website makes no representations whatsoever about any other website which you may access through this one or which may link to this website. When you access a website from our website, please understand that it is independent from our website, and that our website has no control over the content on that website. These links are provided solely as a convenience to you and not as an endorsement by our website of the contents on such third-party Websites.  Our website is not responsible for the content of linked third-party Websites and does not make any representations regarding the content or accuracy of material on such third party Websites.  If you decide to access linked third-party Websites, you do so at your own risk.  We do not necessarily endorse, recommend, suggest or otherwise make any overture or prompt for action regarding any product or service offered.  You should assume we are compensated for any purchases you make.  Again, any income claims should be construed as atypical results and you assume the risk that inferior results obtain, including losses, for which we carry no responsibility or liability.</p>
<p><strong>User Submissions</strong></p>
<p>As a user of our website, you are responsible for your own communications and are responsible for the consequences of their posting.  You must not do the following things: post material that is copyrighted, unless you are the copyright owner or have the permission of the copyright owner to post it; post material that reveals trade secrets, unless you own them or have the permission of the owner; post material that infringes on any other intellectual property rights of others or on the privacy or publicity rights of others; post material that is obscene, profane, defamatory, threatening, harassing, abusive, hateful, or embarrassing to another user of our website or any other person or entity; post a sexually-explicit image; post advertisements or solicitations of business; post chain letters or pyramid schemes; or impersonate another person.</p>
<p>Our website does not represent or guarantee the truthfulness, accuracy, or reliability of any communications posted by other users of our website or endorse any opinions expressed by users of our website.  You acknowledge that any reliance on material posted by other users of our website will be at your own risk.</p>
<p>Our website does not necessarily screen communications in advance and is not responsible for screening or monitoring material posted by users of our website.  If observed by our website and/or notified by a user of communications which allegedly do not conform to this agreement, our website may investigate the allegation and determine in good faith and its sole discretion whether to remove or request the removal of the communication.  Our website has no liability or responsibility to users of our website for performance or nonperformance of such activities. Our website reserves the right to expel users of our website and prevent their further access to our website for violating this agreement or any law or regulation, and also reserves the right to remove communications which are abusive, illegal, or disruptive.</p>
<p><strong>Social Media Warning (Divulgence of Personal &amp; Private Information)</strong></p>
<p>Social media has provided a platform for internet users to disclose much personal information about themselves, in a way that seems innocuous, if not proper and expected.  However, more than a few folks have already lived to regret personal information that was shared either by them or others.  This has long been true of simple email.  It is exponentially true of social websites and applications for social media on any other website, including this one.  You are cautioned against carelessly disclosing information.</p>
<p><strong>3. Indemnification</strong><strong>. </strong></p>
<p>You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless our website, its members, officers, directors, employees, agents, licensors, suppliers and any third party information providers to our website from and against all losses, expenses, damages and costs, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, resulting from any use of our website or violation of this Agreement (including negligent or wrongful conduct) by you or any other person accessing our website.</p>
<p><strong>4. Third Party Rights</strong><strong>. </strong></p>
<p>The provisions of paragraphs 2 (Use of the Service), and 3 (Indemnification) are for the benefit of our website and its owners, officers, directors, employees, agents, licensors, suppliers, and any third party information providers to the Service.  Each of these individuals or entities shall have the right to assert and enforce those provisions directly against you on its/their own behalf.</p>
<p><strong>5.Term; Termination</strong><strong>. </strong></p>
<p>We reserve the right to investigate complaints or reported violations of these Terms of Service and Conditions of Use and to take any action we deem appropriate, including but not limited to reporting any suspected unlawful activity to law enforcement officials, regulators, or other third parties and disclosing any data necessary or appropriate to such persons or entities relating to your profile, email addresses, usage history, IP addresses and traffic data.</p>
<p>This Agreement, in whole or in part, may be terminated without notice at any time for any reason. The provisions of paragraphs 1 (Copyright, Licenses and Idea Submissions), 2 (Use of the Service), 3 (Indemnification), 4 (Third Party Rights), 6 (Hiring an Attorney / No Attorney-Client Relationship), and 7 (Miscellaneous) shall survive any termination of this Agreement, in whole or in part.</p>
<p><strong>6.Hiring an Investment Advisor, Attorney, or Medical or Other Professional / No Attorney-Client Relationship or Fiduciary Capacity</strong><strong>. </strong></p>
<p>Choosing a lawyer, doctor, or investment advisor is a serious matter and should NOT be based solely on data contained on our website or in advertisements.</p>
<p>The law is constantly changing and the data may not be complete or accurate depending on your particular legal issue.  Each legal issue depends on its individual facts and different jurisdictions have different laws and regulations.  This is why you should seriously consider hiring licensed, professional counsel in your jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Medical issues are complex, and can often stem from both organic and psychological factors.  Never should a website be used as a source of diagnosing or treating medical problems.</p>
<p>Financial matters are highly individualistic.  Risk tolerance is just one factor to consider before making any investments or financial decisions.  For these, and other, reasons, you should look to the guidance of a trained professional, not a website.</p>
<p>You may send us email, but in no instance will this communication in any way be construed as initiating an attorney-client relationship, or other professional relationship, and so the contact should not include confidential or sensitive data because your communication will not be treated as privileged or confidential.</p>
<p><strong>7.Miscellaneous</strong><strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Governing Law</strong></p>
<p>This Agreement shall treated as though executed, set in force, and performed in the State of our address on record (“Home State”).  Accordingly, it shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the Home State in terms of those applicable to agreements, without regard to conflict of law principles.</p>
<p><strong>Disputes</strong></p>
<p>Any cause of action by you with respect to our website must be instituted within one (1) year after the cause of action arose or be forever waived and barred. All actions shall be subject to the limitations set forth in these Terms of Service and Conditions of Use.  Any legal claim arising out of or relating to these Terms of Service and Conditions of Use or our website, excluding intellectual property right infringement and other claims by us, shall be settled confidentially through mandatory binding arbitration per the American Arbitration Association commercial arbitration rules.  The arbitration shall be conducted in the Home State.  Each party shall bear one half of the arbitration fees and costs incurred, and each party shall bear its own lawyer fees.  All claims shall be arbitrated on an individual basis, and shall not be consolidated in any arbitration with any claim or controversy of any other party.</p>
<p><strong>Modification</strong></p>
<p>Neither the course of conduct between the parties nor industry trade practice shall act to modify any provision of this Agreement.</p>
<p><strong>Assignability</strong></p>
<p>Our website may assign its rights and duties under this Agreement to any party at any time without notice to you.</p>
<p><strong>Contra Preferentum</strong></p>
<p>The language in these Terms of Service and Conditions of Use shall be interpreted as to its fair meaning and not strictly for or against any party.  Any rule of construction to the effect that ambiguities are to be resolved against the drafting party (i.e. – “contra preferentum”) shall not apply in interpreting these Terms of Service and Conditions of Use, as the Agreement shall be construed as having been co-authored by the parties.</p>
<p><strong>Severability</strong></p>
<p>Should any part of these Terms of Service and Conditions of Use be held invalid or unenforceable, that portion shall be construed as much as possible consistent with applicable law and severability shall apply to the remaining portions, so that they remain in full force and effect.</p>
<p><strong>This Agreement Prevails</strong></p>
<p>To the extent that anything in or associated with our website is in conflict or inconsistent with these Terms of Service and Conditions of Use, these Terms of Service and Conditions of Use shall take precedence.</p>
<p><strong>Waiver</strong></p>
<p>Our failure to enforce any provision of these Terms of Service and Conditions of Use shall not be deemed a waiver of the provision nor of the right to enforce the provision.</p>
<p>Our rights under these Terms of Service and Conditions of Use shall survive any termination of this agreement.</p>
<p>Any rights not expressly granted herein are reserved.</p>
