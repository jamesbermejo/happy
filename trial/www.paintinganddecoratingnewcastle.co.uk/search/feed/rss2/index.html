<section class="av_textblock_section"  itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="https://schema.org/CreativeWork" ><div class='avia_textblock '   itemprop="text" ><p>Painting and Decorating the interior of your Home is probably, the most important thing that can be done to enhance the whole look and feel of it, that is why, we find what we do so rewarding, one change of paint colour here, a few rolls of wallpaper there and suddenly the whole area looks totally different.</p>
<p>Painting and Decorating interiors is what we do, we like to<a href="http://www.paintinganddecoratingnewcastle.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Interior-House-Painting.jpg"><img class="alignright wp-image-3316 size-medium" src="http://www.paintinganddecoratingnewcastle.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Interior-House-Painting-300x148.jpg" alt="Interior-House-Painting" width="300" height="148" /></a> do it, and we are very good at it, not because we were born with a special gift, simply because we have been doing it for so many years, here in Newcastle.</p>
<p>Hundreds of people have invited us into their Homes over the years to take on their painting and decorating in Newcastle and judging on the feedback we receive, we seem to be doing a pretty good job.</p>
<p>We can wallpaper using all sorts of wallpapers, from the simple Blown vinyl, to the special hand printed, extremely expensive wallpapers and everything in between.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.paintinganddecoratingnewcastle.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/in1.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-3242 size-medium" src="http://www.paintinganddecoratingnewcastle.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/in1-300x195.jpg" alt="in1" width="300" height="195" /></a>Painting is something most people think they can do, and to a certain extent they can, however if you want that smooth professional finish, that can make a tired looking skirting board, or window frame look brand new again, then call the experts.</p>
<p>Maybe your home needs painting and decorating, that&#8217;s the reason you are looking at our web site, or possibly, you only need one wall wallpapered, or a touch up on the painting, either way we will be happy to take your call.</p>
<p>Our aim is to advise you on all of your painting and decorating needs, this normally begins with a chat on the phone, and we find out a little about what you want, then we are happy to visit you free of charge to discuss colours and designs.</p>
<p>Remember colours you choose for your painting, can look different depending on the light in your home, we can advise you on this and also on the wallpaper you choose for the decorating.</p>
<p>If you have already chosen what you need and have an idea on how your painting and decorating should look, then we can come along and if we work for you we achieve great results, we look forward to your call.</p>
